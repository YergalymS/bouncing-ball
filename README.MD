# Bouncing Ball Game

This is a simple Pygame application featuring a bouncing ball within a shrinking square. The game displays the number of bounces and dynamically changes the colors of the ball and square, including a trailing effect for the ball. It also includes background music that plays during the game.

## Features

- **Bouncing Ball:** The ball bounces off the sides of a square that decreases in size with each bounce.
- **Color Changes:** The color of the ball and square changes randomly and smoothly over time.
- **Trailing Effect:** The ball leaves a fading trail that follows its movement.
- **Bounce Count:** The total number of bounces is displayed on the screen.
- **Background Music:** An instrumental sound plays in the background.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

You can install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the code file.

2. Make sure you have the instrumental.wav sound file in the same directory as the script.

3. Run the script:

```bash
python bouncing_ball.py
```

## Code Overview
- **Initialization:** Sets up Pygame and initializes screen dimensions, colors, and sound.
- **Ball Movement:** Updates ball position based on velocity, handles bouncing and collision with the square.
- **Color Changes:** Smoothly transitions ball and square colors over time.
- **Tail Effect:** Updates and draws a trail of the ball's previous positions.
- **Bounce Count:** Displays the number of bounces on the screen.
- **Background Music:** Plays an instrumental sound when the game starts.


## Code Details
- `random_velocity_change(velocity)`: Alters the ball's velocity slightly upon bouncing.
- `smooth_color_change(color, step=1)`: Randomly changes the color of the ball and square.
- `fade_color(color, factor)`: Fades the color of the ball's trail based on its position.

## Notes
- The square size decreases by a fixed amount with each bounce until it reaches a minimum size.
- The ballâ€™s color changes smoothly, and its trail fades based on its age.
- The background music starts playing when the game starts and continues throughout the game.
